# Learning-23

Some of the codes learned during my training to become a software developer.

I know I'm just at the beginning, but it can show you some aspects of my coding Type.
Some of the codes are not finished yet. This is because my traineeship is seperated in different themed modules and there is not much time to complete codes, because there are many different theoretical topics to learn.
